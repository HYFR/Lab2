This program follows the objective outlined for lab 2. I was not able to create the T, S or W commands.
The queue that I created is not a circular queue, if the queue is filled it will empty itself out.
You as the user are able to input numbers into the queue, delete the numbers, display the contents of the queue
and exit out of the program.
The commands are initialized through the numbers 1-4 respectively.
